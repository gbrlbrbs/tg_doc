\section{Planned results}

With the presented methodology, we list the following parts that are central to the problem's solution:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
	\item definition of the dataset(s) to use;
	\item GAN architecture implementation;
	\item usage of ISA over the selected dataset(s) and adjustment of GAN training or network architecture;
	\item analysis of the generated instances.
\end{enumerate}
