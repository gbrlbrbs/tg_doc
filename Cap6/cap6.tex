In this chapter we present the conclusions of this work and some ideas for further work.

\section{Conclusions}

We conclude this work by noting that the explored model did not function as expected. The generated data after the IS calculation was not in the region we wanted, and the calculated instance space values were not correlated with the original values. This is a sign that the model is not working as intended. We believe that the model proposed of decoder-encoder is not complex enough to learn the instance space.

\section{Further work}

We believe the instance space reduces the amount of data too much for a proper representation to be learned by a fully connected neural network model. We propose that either the instance space be expanded into more dimensions or that the model use incorporates some process of the dimensionality reduction caused by the instance space analysis.
