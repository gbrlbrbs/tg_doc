One topic of study in Machine Learning is the study of algorithmic performance and which methodologies may be used to assess this performance. A methodology known as Instance Space Analysis has been used to relate predictive performance in classification algorithms to instance hardness (how hard an instance is for an algorithm to classify). The original methodology has been defined with the instance being an entire dataset, but further work has been made to make the instance as fine-grained as an individual observation. In this work we will build upon this methodology and we propose the creation of a generative neural network model to generate new observations for a classification algorithm with predefined hardness properties.
